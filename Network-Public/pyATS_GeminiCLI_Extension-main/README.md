# pyATS Gemini-CLI Extension
An Extension for Gemini-CLI that enables pyATS 

## How to add to Gemini-CLI

```bash
export PYATS_TESTBED_PATH="$SERVERS_DIR/testbed.yaml"

gemini extensions install https://github.com/automateyournetwork/pyATS_GeminiCLI_Extension.git

```

## Customize testbed.yaml 

Inside the .gemini/extensions/pyats/servers folder there is a default testbed.yaml that works with the DevNet CML Sandbox for testing. 

Replace this with your testbed file before launching Gemini-CLI
